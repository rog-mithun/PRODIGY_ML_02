# Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

## Overview

This project applies K-means clustering to perform customer segmentation based on features such as annual income and spending score. The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters for targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset

## Files

- `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
- `Mall_Customers.csv`: Original dataset used for customer segmentation.
- `Mall_Customers_Clustered.csv`: CSV file containing the clustered dataset with optimal clusters.
